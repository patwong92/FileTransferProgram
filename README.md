# FileTransferProgram

This Windows-based program is designed to open and send file data through over a TCP or UDP connection. The GUI offers fields to specify the host address, port, file name, and packet size. The output will be displayed to the GUI textbox.

To run the executable, go to Release and select FileTransferProgram.exe.

The program can either be a client or a server, so run two instances of the application. One program can be the client, and the other program can be the server.
